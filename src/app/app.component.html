  // WORKING HERE :: THIS IS NEXT. You need a solution for the "is value used check" which is currently a pipe
  // the solution is to have a "usedValues" array in the store
  // which is UPDATED every time the cellHistory changes
  // handle this in an effect



  ...then...
  "WORKING HERE !!! utilize behavior subject"
  this is to move all number pad interaction into a reactive pattern

    - offload logic to services
  - smaller sub-components
  - add husky pre commit hooks (ng lint)
